## Character traits
All characters have point values in five areas: Diplomacy, Martial, Stewardship, Intrigue and Learning. These point values indicate the character's ability to do certain things and compete for chivalric dominance. They are described below:

### Diplomacy
This value represents the character's ability to negotiate, persuade and convince. When in battle, this character may be able to intimidate and shame opponents into submission. 

### Martial
This value represents the character's ability to fight, strategize and joust. When in battle, this character may use their overwhelming strength to strike down and oppress their opponents.

### Stewardship
This value represents the character's ability to manage their properties and maintain an income. When in battle, this character may possess the best gear and equipment, defeating foes with their wallets.

### Intrigue
This value represents the character's cunning, not to mention the lengths that they will go get what they want. When in battle, this character may backstab or trick their opponent. 

### Learning
This value represents the character's education and, by extension, their knowledge of history and lore which could be an aid to them. When in battle, they can use advanced strategies from the past to assist them. 

## Personae dramatis

### Parzival
Sir Parzival Angevin of the Round Table was an ascendant star among King Arthur's court, until he caused the current predicament that we currently find ourselves in, that is. Born to King Gahmuret and Queen Herzeloyde, he was orphaned at a young age. Finding himself at Camelot, he quickly distinguished himself as a man of incredible courage, though he wasn't always the brightest candle in the chandelier. After freeing his wife, Queen Condwiramurs from the clutches of an evil wizard, he was invited to Munsalvaesche, but failed to ask Anfortas the question of his wound. He was quickly removed from the premises and cursed to never return. The land, too, was cursed on his account. Learning that the land was plagued due to his mistake, he has vowed to regain Munsalvaesche and claim the Grail.

After Parzival's failure at Munsalvaesche, he too swore to gain the Grail and redeem Camelot. In doing, he is charged with murder, joins a war and finds himself trapped in the clutches of a magician Clinschor. Defeating him and several other chivalrous knights, he is wed to the great Orgeluse and saves her land from destruction. Though he has accommplished great things as a knight, he has yet to set eyes on Munsalvaesche and can't help but be compared to the wondrous Parzival.

He is pie-bald, bespeckled with black splotches all over his body. Nonetheless, his fighting strength and devotion mark him as a true warrior and Angevin knight.

No longer the same menace in the saddle he was in his youth, he has learned much from that sage Merlin and is still as capable on the battlefield as anyone else assembled to gain the Grail. Though a combatant in the contest, he is also its leader and everyone gives him deference. She wants but one thing: to ease the stress of the Grail's curse, even if it means he must teach these younger folk a lesson.
