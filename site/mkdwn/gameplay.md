# Gameplay

## Rules
Gameplay will seek to simulate the tournament for the Grail. Anfortas, the Grail Hero, must be redeemed from his horrible wound by the most chivalric player. Players must prove their chivalry on the filed of battle and by striking down their fellow players, though it will be up to Anfortas who will ultimately be given the protectorship of the Grail. 

Gameplay will follow the courses of our dinner. At the start of the dinner, every player begins with 10 Honor points. Once a course is served, each player will have the option to call into question the honor of another, in the form of a duel. They will fight according to their traits (see below) and depending on the result, the loser will lose a certain amount of Honor. Once their honor reaches zero, they will be unable to challenge others or be challenged. At the end of the course, that is when everyone is done eating, Anfortas will chose a certain number of players to be eliminated from the Grail contest out of those with the lowest Honor. 

## Duels
When one player challenges another player to a duel, each must choose a major and a minor trait from their character traits. The corresponding major and minor traits of each player will be subtracted from each other. The player with the positive trait balance after subtraction rolls a die (this will be done for them) with a number sides equal to the trait balance after subtraction. The rolled value will be the amount of Honor that the loser will lose. Minor traits have this value halved rounding down. 

For example, if player A challenges player B, first A will choose two traits (let's say a major trait of Diplomacy at 16 and a minor trait of Martial at 13), then B will choose two traits (let's say a major trait of Martial at 14 and a minor trait of Intrigue at 14). Next, the major traits are subtracted resulting in a balance towards A of 2. A would then roll a D2, getting in this example a 1, meaning B will lose 1 Honor. Last, the minor traits are subtracted resulting in a balance towards B of 1, but this value must be halved and then rounded down, leading to 0. Because this value is 0, no die needs to be rolled and A will lose no Honor. 

## Affinities and aversions
Certain traits interact with other traits, leading to affinities and aversions as described below:

### Diplomacy
* Diplomacy is x2 effective against Stewardship.
* Diplomacy is ineffective against Intrigue.

### Martial
* Martial is x1.5 (rounding down) effective against Learning.
* Martial is x.5 (rounding down) effective against Intrigue.

### Stewardship
* Stewardship is x2 effective against Intrigue.
* Stewardship is ineffective against Learning.

### Intrigue
* Intrigue is x2 effective against Diplomacy
* Intrigue is x.5 (rounding down) effective against Learning.

### Learning
* Learning is x2 effective against Stewardship.
* Learning is ineffective against Martial.

## Special abilities:
Each character has a special ability. These may only be invoked, depending on their specifications, after both players have chosen their major and minor traits.
